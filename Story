      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Samark was built to solve a common problem: great businesses struggling to scale because of poor marketing systems.</p>
    </header>
    <p>
      It started with a question: “What if marketing could be engineered like a trading strategy?” Not just flashy ads and half-baked funnels—but structured, repeatable systems grounded in data. That’s how Samark began. What started as a college experiment in market psychology and conversion logic grew into a disciplined approach to helping brands grow predictably and profitably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing from the principles of market structure, breakout strategies, and behavioral science, we built marketing systems that function like precision instruments. We don’t chase trends. We architect growth. With a foundation in trading logic and a passion for design, Samark fuses technical rigor with bold storytelling—helping businesses scale not just quickly, but sustainably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work is built on discipline. Every campaign follows a proven workflow: research, refine, deploy, optimize. We treat your funnel like a portfolio—tracking performance, identifying inefficiencies, and rebalancing for maximum ROI. Whether you’re a solo founder launching a lean startup or a seasoned operator preparing for your next growth phase, Samark becomes your marketing control tower.
