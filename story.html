      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Samark was built to solve a common problem: great businesses struggling to scale because of poor marketing systems.</p>
    </header>

    <p>It started with a question: “What if marketing could be engineered like a trading strategy?” Not just flashy ads and half-baked funnels—but structured, repeatable systems grounded in data. That’s how Samark began. What started as a college experiment in market psychology and conversion logic grew into a disciplined approach to helping brands grow predictably and profitably.</p>

    <p>Drawing from the principles of market structure, breakout strategies, and behavioral science, we built marketing systems that function like precision instruments. We don’t chase trends. We architect growth. With a foundation in trading logic and a passion for design, Samark fuses technical rigor with bold storytelling—helping businesses scale not just quickly, but sustainably.</p>

    <p>Our work is built on discipline. Every campaign follows a proven workflow: research, refine, deploy, optimize. We treat your funnel like a portfolio—tracking performance, identifying inefficiencies, and rebalancing for maximum ROI. Whether you’re a solo founder launching a lean startup or a seasoned operator preparing for your next growth phase, Samark becomes your marketing control tower.</p>

    <p>We believe clarity builds trust, systems drive scale, and strategy is stronger than any shortcut. Samark doesn’t just run ads. We create conversion machines. From email sequences to branding identity, from outreach logic to analytics refinement—every piece has a purpose.</p>

    <p>You do what you do best. We build the growth engine behind it. This is where your business becomes its boldest version yet. Welcome to Samark.</p>
